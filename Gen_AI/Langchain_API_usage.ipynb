This separation of concerns allows for better organization and maintainability of code.\\n\\nOne of the key features of Flask is its flexibility and extensibility. It comes with a minimal set of core functionalities, allowing developers to customize and add features as needed. Flask also has a built-in development server and debugger, making it easy to test and debug applications locally. Additionally, Flask supports a wide range of extensions and libraries, making it possible to add functionality such as user authentication, database integration, and more. With its simplicity and versatility, Flask is a popular choice for building web applications of any size and complexity.'"
