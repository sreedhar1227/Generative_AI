Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\\n\\n  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\\nfalling down a very deep well.\"),\n",

She was close behind it when she turned the\\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\\nhanging from the roof.\\n\\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\\nother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\\nwondering how she was ever to get out again.\\n\\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\\ndoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\\nthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\\nthem.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\"),\n",

Oh, how I wish\\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\\nknow how to begin.\\'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\\nhad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\\nthings indeed were really impossible.\\n\\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\\ntelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\\ncertainly was not here before,\\' said Alice,) and round the neck\\nof the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME\\'\\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\\n\\n  It was all very well to say `Drink me,\\' but the wise little\\nAlice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I\\'ll look\\nfirst,\\' she said, `and see whether it\\'s marked \"poison\" or not\\';\\nfor she had read several nice little histories about children who\\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\\nthings, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\\ntheir friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\\nwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\\n`poison,\\' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\\nlater.'),\n",
